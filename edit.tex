\begin{frame}{The Edit that Changed the World}{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Benjamin Franklin made extreme edits to Jefferson's first draft
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Got rid of all words involving religion and "undeniable"
				\item Replaced "divine authority" with "self-evident"
			\end{itemize}
		\item Franklin's edit arguably allowed America to become the scientific powerhouse that it is today
		\item Jefferson also added ideas of natural law and liberty
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Although he did not see conflict between science and religion, but rather, believed they should merely be separate
			\end{itemize}
		\item Definition of liberty must be consistent with itself, and consistent with plain matter-of-fact
		\item Franklin made the argument that Jefferson's words caused confusion, due to them being based on belief, and not scientific
		\item Wanted to stay away from words involving God, to not get back to sayings like "God save the monarchy" whare are always arguable assumptions
		\item Created a nation that respected and tolerated religion, but was not reliant upon it
	\end{itemize}
