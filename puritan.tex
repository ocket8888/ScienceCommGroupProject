	\begin{itemize}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Indictment of Galileo
				\item Disliked denial of opinions supported by observation of nature, therefore evidence of God's will, because it conflicted with scripture
			\end{itemize}
		\item Believed the Church of England was too Catholic
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Demanded a new translation of the Bible in 1604 (the "King James" version)
				\item Believed having a monarch that was also the head of a church was incompatible and hypocritically self-serving
			\end{itemize}
		\item King Charles I's reintroduction of Catholicism to England and similar absolutism behavior led to Puritan migration to America
