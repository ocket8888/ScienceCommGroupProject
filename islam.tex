\begin{frame}{The Islamic Keepers of Science}{}
	Islam was the leader in scientific knowledge up through he 15th century. With the largest scientific university at the time, they were able to translate and communicate all aspects of math and science to all different languages and religions. However, when the Renaissance began, a religionist culture switch in Islam made God more popular than science and their scientific advances came to a halt while European scientists and philosophers took over.
