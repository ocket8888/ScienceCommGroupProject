%-------------------------------------------------------
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Western Christianity is composed of two main groups:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Roman Catholicism\\
				Believe in tradition and that the Pope is the only way to God
			\item Protestantism\\
				Believe that the Catholic Church is corrupt and that everyone can have an individual relationship with God
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Luther (Protestant) used the printing press to sell over 100,000 bibles in forty years so that people could read the Bible and come to their own conclusions
		\item This was the beginning of a split in Western thought between anti-authoritarian and authoritarian views in government, economics, and science
