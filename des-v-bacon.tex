%-------------------------------------------------------
	Descartes focused on the "mind-body split"
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Said that conclusions are only valid if they follow logically from the premise
		\item "I think therefore I am" - \textit{Renee Descartes}
		\item Wanted to embrace skepticism
		\item Said that senses are unreliable and a source of untruth and illusion\\
			Only reliable from a mind that was separate from the body
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bacon}
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Descartes vs. Bacon}{Bacon}
%-------------------------------------------------------
	Bacon focused on science and published a "New Instrument of Science"
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Inductive reasoning -\\
			From bottom up, observing with senses and then building logical steps to reach a general conclusion about reality
		\item His method is "Flawed" because conclusions are provisional and leave room to be disproved
	\end{itemize}
	Bacon's method is good for science because it
	\begin{itemize}
		\item contains a provisional "probably" statement
		\item shows how math and science have become important, quantifies whether a relative probability is T/F
	\end{itemize}
