\begin{frame}{The Sciencist-Politician}{Thomas Jefferson}
%-------------------------------------------------------
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Appointed by the Continental Congress to draft the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was heavily influenced by Isaac Newton and Edward Coke's writings to establish:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A limit on the power of a monarch by writing a document for the US that was based on knowledge and reason, not God
				\item A country based on the rule of men, a democracy, which would be appealing to people of all religions and denominations as one would not have power over the others
			\end{itemize}
		\item As president he commissioned the Lewis and Clark expedition. He received support for it from Congress by presenting it as an economic initiative, but in reality he ordered Lewis to undergo the journey as though it were a scientific expedition.
